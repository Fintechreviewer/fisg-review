    <h1>FISG Review: Is FISG.com a Scam or Legit? 🚨</h1>
    <p><strong>FISG</strong>, a brokerage firm operating under the website <a href="https://fisg.com" target="_blank">fisg.com</a>, is a prime example of the risks associated with unregulated offshore brokers. Operated by <strong>Interstellar Financial Group Limited</strong> (incorporated in St. Vincent and the Grenadines) and managed by <strong>First Interstellar Global Ltd</strong> (incorporated in Seychelles), FISG raises significant red flags for traders seeking a reliable and secure trading environment. This review delves into the concerning practices of FISG, highlighting why it should be avoided at all costs.</p>

    <h2>Is FISG.com a Scam? 🕵️‍♂️</h2>
    <p>FISG exhibits several characteristics of a scam broker, including lack of regulation, questionable business practices, and manipulated reviews. Below, we break down the key issues:</p>

    <h3>1. Lack of Regulation and Financial Protection 🚫</h3>
    <p>FISG operates in unregulated jurisdictions, leaving traders with no financial protection. Here’s a comparison of FISG’s regulatory status versus reputable brokers:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Broker</th>
            <th>Regulatory Authority</th>
            <th>Financial Protection</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>FISG</td>
            <td>None (St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles)</td>
            <td>No protection</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Reputable Brokers</td>
            <td>FCA (UK), CySEC (Cyprus), ASIC (Australia)</td>
            <td>Up to £85,000 (FCA), €20,000 (CySEC), etc.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>2. Questionable Business Practices ⚠️</h3>
    <p>FISG employs several tactics typical of scam brokers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High Leverage:</strong> Offers 1:500 leverage, far beyond the limits set by reputable regulators.</li>
        <li><strong>High Spreads:</strong> EUR/USD spread of 2.2 pips, significantly above the industry average.</li>
        <li><strong>Aggressive Upselling:</strong> Encourages clients to deposit large sums for better trading conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Offshore Banking and Lack of Transparency 🌍</h3>
    <p>FISG requires clients to transfer funds into offshore bank accounts, making it difficult to recover funds. This lack of transparency is a major red flag.</p>

    <h3>4. Dubious Online Presence and Manipulated Reviews 📉</h3>
    <p>FISG has a minimal online presence, and the few reviews available (e.g., on Trustpilot) are likely manipulated. Traders should not rely on these reviews for an accurate assessment of the broker.</p>

    <h3>5. Representatives in Singapore and Cyprus: A Smokescreen 🕶️</h3>
    <p>FISG claims to have representatives in Singapore and Cyprus, but this is likely a tactic to create an illusion of legitimacy. The broker remains unregulated and unsafe.</p>

    <h2>How to Recover Funds from a Scam Like FISG 💰</h2>
    <p>If you’ve fallen victim to FISG or a similar scam, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Document Everything:</strong> Keep records of all transactions, communications, and account details.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact a Fund Recovery Service:</strong> Use a professional service like <a href="https://secureform.cncintel.com/cncintelligence/form/BP/formperma/W6dSGqsKM2cxBeHFtd8jGzagYDJun_9TjlK_l3BPBkY" target="_blank">this one</a> to recover your funds.</li>
        <li><strong>Report the Scam:</strong> File a complaint with relevant authorities in your country.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Conclusion: Avoid FISG at All Costs 🛑</h2>
    <p>FISG is a highly suspicious broker with all the hallmarks of a scam. From its lack of regulation to its questionable practices, traders are strongly advised to avoid FISG and opt for regulated brokers instead. Protect your investments and steer clear of FISG and similar offshore entities.</p>
